const aboutMe = [
  "A Fullstack Developer who enjoys building clean and functional user interfaces. Making sure they look, work and scale up to a wonderful user experience.",
  "Currently, I'm a Fullstack Developer at CLV Innovation Technology, a software house where I handle development and support for a Singapore-based F&B chain.",
  "Before getting into tech, I spent a few years in business and administrative roles, handling everything from customer service to contracts and operations. During that time, I had the chance to meet people from various industries, including those working in tech — which inspired me to pursue this path.",
  "In my spare time, I'm usually hanging out with friends, playing badminton, or (more recently) discovering the joy of climbing."
